## Pole-Zero Plot Function

**Issue**

In control systems engineering, analyzing the poles and zeros of a system is crucial for understanding its stability and performance. While MATLAB provides built-in tools for this purpose, having a dedicated function for visualizing poles and zeros in both the s-domain (Laplace Transform) and z-domain (Z-Transform) improves efficiency and accessibility.

**Solution**

This repository includes a MATLAB function that automates pole-zero plotting for both continuous-time and discrete-time transfer functions. By using this function, engineers and researchers can quickly gain insights into system behavior without manually configuring plots.

## Installation and Setup

Ensure MATLAB is installed, along with the necessary toolboxes for control system analysis.
Download or clone this repository.
Place the function file in your working MATLAB directory.

## Usage

The function allows users to input a transfer function and automatically generate pole-zero plots. It supports both continuous-time (Laplace domain) and discrete-time (Z domain) systems, helping users assess stability and response characteristics.

## Features

Visualizes poles and zeros of a given system.
Supports both continuous-time and discrete-time transfer functions.
Enhances system analysis by providing a clear representation of stability properties.

## Applications

Control system stability assessment.
Signal processing and filter design.
Understanding system dynamics through pole-zero analysis.
